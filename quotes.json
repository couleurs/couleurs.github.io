    "I used to pay attention to the clouds in the sky.. .I paid close attention for a month to see if they ever repeated. They don't repeat.",
    "Inspiration is there all the time for anyone whose mind is not covered over with thoughts.",
    "Inspiration comes from a clear mind. Right straight through. We have nothing to do with it."
